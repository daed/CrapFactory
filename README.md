## Crapfactory

### Murk up advertising companies with random requests.

Fighting megacorporations intent on tracking your every move online is becoming a losing battle.  We're approaching an age where not having (and regularly exercising) a google or facebook account causes someone to become a second-class citizen, and in many locations, it is becoming hard to even find some products without ordering through Amazon.

The situation is bleak, but I offer a potential alternative.  In about every situation, bad data is worse than no data.  So rather than trying to shield your tidbits from these companies, flood them with so much random garbage that they cannot tell your real information from your fake.

So enters crap factory.  The aim of this extension is to make a random search, click, or post every time you visit a site.
